# Extracting Better Code From LLMs

## "I write bugs.
        Eventually the computer will write code for me and it won't have any bugs."

# Has the time come?
        not quite
# 🐞

# Motivation

* LLMs are powerful tools to write code

* But the code they produce is not always good
        - security holes
        - performance issues
        - ugly code
        - just plain wrong

* What can we do to get better code from LLMs?
---

# Hypothesis:

* There are probably many ways to improve code quality generation, but *let's explore just one.*

* Maybe we can use LLMs on the generated code to rate and improve their own code quality?

* Let's test it.


---


# Building Block 1: Description -> Code

    def desc_to_code(description):
        result = gpt3(f'# Given the description of a function,
                        write the code in python.\n{description}\n\ndef my_function')

        return "def my_function" + result

---

# why don't we just ask GPT3 to rate the code it wrote?

        ***prompt engineering intensifies***

---

# Building Block 2: Code -> Code Quality Score

    def code_quality_rating(code):
        result = gpt3(
            f'Given the code of a function, give a quality,
              clarity, cleanliness and good-engineering score.
              Give only a single overall number score from 0-100
              with 0 being awful and 100 being perfect.\nFunction: {code}\nScore:')

        return float(result)

---

# Building Block 3: Code -> Buggy Code Score

    def code_has_bugs(code):
        result = gpt3(
            f'Given the code of a function, think carefully about the safety
              and correctness of the code. Give the likelihood that there bugs.
              If you definitely see any bugs, write 100. If you are completely
              sure you do not see any bugs, say 0. Give the score between 0 and 100.
              Give only the score. \nFunction: {code}\nBug score:')

        return float(result)

# Another idea.

Does GPT3 understand what the code it wrote does?

Does it match what we wanted?

---

# Building Block 4: Code -> Description

---

# Building Block 5: Code -> Code with names removed

* We don't want GPT3 to cheat by looking at the names of the variables.

* The intent of the code should be clear from the structure of the code and what functions are called.

* So remove the names of the variables before asking GPT3 to explain what the code does.

---

# Building Block 6: Two Descriptions -> Similarity Score

* Given the original description and the reversed description, how similar are they?

* Code that is similar to the original description is more likely to be good and solve the problem.

* Code that GPT3 can't explain properly is probably bad.

* Code that is different from the original description is probably bad.

---
# Putting it all together
* Given a function description...
* Generate 10 generated code samples using GPT3
* For each generated code sample...
    * Rate the code quality
    * Rate the likelihood of bugs
    * Remove the variable names to avoid cheating
    * Reverse the code to get a description
    * Rate the similarity of the description to the original description
    * Calculate a final score for the code sample
* Return the best scoring code samples!

# Results

# It failed to find a bug in its own code

        function to get the list of docker container ids
        that are running and return them as a list

    def my_function():
        # import the subprocess module
        import subprocess

        # set up a list to capture the output of the subprocess call
        output = []

        # call the docker ps command to get a list of running containers
        ps_call = subprocess.run(['docker', 'ps'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        # loop through the output of subprocess
        for line in ps_call.stdout.splitlines():
            # split each line by a whitespace
            columns = line.split()
            # store the container id in the output list
            output.append(columns[0])

        # return the list of container ids
        return output

            [b'CONTAINER', b'8a45549c4a88', b'1be97890b8a7']

# Key Learnings

* You can write code that thinks about code, and ask it questions like you would ask a human

* Silly things like rating the bugginess of code are very possible

* But GPT3 cannot necessarily find the bugs it wrote

* Many code transformations are possible

* These silly functions sometimes return completely invalid results - error handling is important

* Much better results are possible than just using the LLMs directly

* You'll spend all your money on GPT3 if you do this

* Much of this presentation was written with a LLM
